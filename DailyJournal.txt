For my internship, I'm working at Desjardins in the Data Virtualization (Virtualisation de données) department. We're working with Autonodo and Denodo softwares to centralize the databases of the company and make everything more streamlined.

My internship is from September 7th to December 23rd, so by the time I'm writing this I've started almost a month ago. As of now I'm working with Java but officially I am to help design the interface in React Typescript.

**October 3rd**
My first task was given to me last Wednesday, I had Thursday and Friday off so this is my second day working on my task. It basically consists of refactoring some codes into a new class. I've been reading a lot of documentation but tomorrow morning I have a few questions I will ask my team leader to help me understand better the overall project and to make sure I'm on the right path.

**October 4th**
I asked my team leader for some help this morning and continued working on my task. We had an hour long meeting in the afternoon to talk about Azure architecture and talk about things related to what we're doing. 

**October 5th**
Finished my task, tomorrow we will make sure the tests that run parallel to it work properly. We had the end of our 3 weeks sprint today, so there was a few meetings about that, and another explaining Autonodo to a team that will test run it. 

**October 6th**
Start working on an interface to be able to do tests relating to Denodo. It's in react typescript and I'll probably be working on it for the duration of my internship. Talked about the next sprint and had a few "récits" laid out for me.

**October 7th**
Continued working on my interface, did the navbar and the header, made sure everything was in order. Installed the right dependencies and what not. 

**October 11th**
Working on the html/css aspect of the interface, completed the header and the navbar, making my way to the main body soon. Trying to make my code as clear as possible and I'm learning typescript as I go along since it's new to me.

**October 12th**
Working my way through the main body of the page, creating the controller tables to able to do tests at some point. Still working on the front-end though, and probably will for a few days or a week until I can take a look at the back-end and connect everything together.

**October 13th**
Continuing my interface, my main challenge from yesterday is to make nested dropdown menu. My goal is to do that today and be able to work on the design of the testing table.

**October 14th**
Another day in sunny Desjardins. I got the hang of the nested dropdown menus and I'm working on the main testing interface now, so far so good. Things are looking good and I'm able to add more stuff everyday. I believe I have maybe one more weeks of mostly designing the page. Then I'll remove the test content and replace it with actual content.
