For my internship, I'm working at Desjardins in the Data Virtualization (Virtualisation de données) department. We're working with Autonodo and Denodo softwares to centralize the databases of the company and make everything more streamlined.

My internship is from September 7th to December 23rd, so by the time I'm writing this I've started almost a month ago. As of now I'm working with Java but officially I am to help design the interface in React Typescript.

**October 3rd**
My first task was given to me last Wednesday, I had Thursday and Friday off so this is my second day working on my task. It basically consists of refactoring some codes into a new class. I've been reading a lot of documentation but tomorrow morning I have a few questions I will ask my team leader to help me understand better the overall project and to make sure I'm on the right path.

**October 4th**
I asked my team leader for some help this morning and continued working on my task. We had an hour long meeting in the afternoon to talk about Azure architecture and talk about things related to what we're doing. 

**October 5th**
Finished my task, tomorrow we will make sure the tests that run parallel to it work properly. We had the end of our 3 weeks sprint today, so there was a few meetings about that, and another explaining Autonodo to a team that will test run it. 

**October 6th**
Start working on an interface to be able to do tests relating to Denodo. It's in react typescript and I'll probably be working on it for the duration of my internship. Talked about the next sprint and had a few "récits" laid out for me.

**October 7th**
Continued working on my interface, did the navbar and the header, made sure everything was in order. Installed the right dependencies and what not. 

**October 11th**
Working on the html/css aspect of the interface, completed the header and the navbar, making my way to the main body soon. Trying to make my code as clear as possible and I'm learning typescript as I go along since it's new to me.

**October 12th**
Working my way through the main body of the page, creating the controller tables to able to do tests at some point. Still working on the front-end though, and probably will for a few days or a week until I can take a look at the back-end and connect everything together.

**October 13th**
Continuing my interface, my main challenge from yesterday is to make nested dropdown menu. My goal is to do that today and be able to work on the design of the testing table.

**October 14th**
Another day in sunny Desjardins. I got the hang of the nested dropdown menus and I'm working on the main testing interface now, so far so good. Things are looking good and I'm able to add more stuff everyday. I believe I have maybe one more weeks of mostly designing the page. Then I'll remove the test content and replace it with actual content.

**October 17th**
Almost done with the html/css aspect of my interface. I just have one button to complete which will make some fields appear to write data to test in. But overall it's looking good! Then I will have to change the "sample data" for real data, and a bunch of other fun stuff that'll probably take me a bit.

**October 18th**
I finished the design (html/css) aspect of my interface and showed them to my team. They liked it alot but would like me to make it a bit simpler so I've been simpifying it a bit in the afternoon. Tomorrow I hope to finish that and start working on the classes and functions.

**October 19th**
Continued working on my simplified design page. Summoning my inner Steve Jobs to make sure everything is nice and clean yet simple to use and intuitive. 

**October 20th**
Worked on the hooks for my form and cleaned my code a bit.

**October 21st**
Finished the form section of my interface and made sure everything is okay. Next week I'll start connecting it to the backend.

**October 24th**
Today I was a bit sick, so I didn't do as much coding but did a lot of reading about Autonodo/Denodo and watched videos about connecting react's client side to springboot's server side.

**October 25th**
I had a meeting with my "marraine de stage" to understand better how to connect my interface to the back-end and receive some feedbacks on my interface. Did a bit of coding and modifications here and there and continued reading about it.

**October 26th**
Had a sprint review, I've been working on connecting my react typescript front end to the pre-existing springboot backend, hoping to make it work soon and get a few tests going.

**October 27th**
Working on connecting the client side (my react project) to server side (the pre-existing springboot project)

**October 28th**
Managed to connect the client side to the server side, but receiving errors while testing. Trying to figure out how to fix the bugs.

**October 31st, the spookiest of days**
Working on getting the results from the back-end to show in my front-end. Looking at resources online and trying different things. Inching closer to a solution but not quite there yet. It's my goal of the week.

**November 1st**
Still working on the same problem, getting closer though. I have different errors so that's usually a good thing right. 

**November 2nd**
Managed to get my POST to post to the back-end, still not showing the results of the tests but it's a big step forward! Had a bit of help from a co-worker to figure out what the problem could be and we figured the code was okay, but there was something that kept my POST to connect to the back-end.

**November 3rd**
Continued working on connecting my client side to the server side. I need the test file to be able to see a working 200 response but so far things seem better. 

**November 4th**
Managed to get a few more things working here, there's no one to help me today but on Monday I have a call to receive the test file and then continue working on it. I'm not able to receive a response directly on the interface yet, only in the console, so that'll be the next step.

**November 7th**
Still working on getting a 200 response from my interface when I send a form. Changing a few things, reading a lot of documentations and keeping on.

**November 8th**
Had a small meeting a with a co-worker to receive some help for this, he taught me a few things that were very helpful, but we didn't find the answer yet. So I continue my journey and am crossing my fingers to find a solution soon.

**November 9th**
Sick day :(

**November 10th**
Sick day #2 :(

**November 11th**
Jour du Souvenir holiday

**November 14th**
Still working on getting my client side interface to properly push data to the server side and retrieve the information

**November 15th**
It works! I was able to make the app work, finally. My web page can now properly push the data to the server side and receive the test confirmation (success or fail) back. Tomorrow is the end of the 3 weeks sprint and I'm very happy to be able to show my working app :). I have a few things to polish and then send it to prod but I'm very happy.

**November 16th**
Had the end of the 3 weeks sprint. Showed what I did and got a few suggestions and I've been working on adding those suggestions to my page. 

**November 17th**
Trying to implement the response from Denodo to my project, trying to figure out how to display the response body in the page itself.

**November 18th**
Managed to implement the response body to my page! It now shows the response in html as coded by Denodo when you sent a request to the server. I'm super stoked :).

**November 21st**
Finished my first complete project :) Started working on my second, which is to take a virtual database validation report that already exists and add some functionalities and make it better looking.

**November 22nd**
Started adding more functionalities, such as the date and making errors always appear before warnings in the data table. Slowly making my way to make it look nicer and the code cleaner.

**November 23rd**
Hard coded the result table for the validations, reading up some documentation on Thymeleaf since this time I'm working on a html page directly in a Java Springboot project, and Thymeleaf is used for it.

**November 24th**
Team building day! Can you believe it? We had a little meeting in the morning and then went for lunch and to do some axe throwing! Super fun.

**November 25th**
Tried some stuff such as showing the Database's name in the validation report and what not. Not a lot of success, mostly spent the day reading up on Thymeleaf and trying different things.

**November 28th**
Continued working on my validation page, had some help from my project leader to and changed some code in Java to be able to display the database name and what not. Continued reading documentation on Thymeleaf.

**November 29th**
Same thing different day. Had another small meeting with my project leader to help me out and managed to get some things working. Struggling a bit with how to display some information so I'm trying different things and reading more documentation.

**November 30th**
Managed to make the title of the page change depending on if the test was successful or if it's failed, with a green or red backdrop. Read more documentation on Denodo to understand how to show the total tests run and the success to fail ratio.

**December 1st**
Finished my interface, everything works fine. Created some javascript codes to display the succesful/warning/failed tests and made everything slick and nice.

**December 2nd**
Made sure everything was in order, did some small random tasks and training but no new tasks assigned yet.

**December 5th**
Reviewed my code and did a pull request to merge it in the master branch. Did not do much coding, a lot of things are happening in our team and tomorrow is the christmas' party so I'll have my next task on Wednesday.

**December 6h**
Christmas party! Team building activies in the day and dinner at a restaurant at 5pm. It's a 3 hours drive so no work done in the day.
