For my internship, I'm working at Desjardins in the Data Virtualization (Virtualisation de données) department. We're working with Autonodo and Denodo softwares to centralize the databases of the company and make everything more streamlined.

My internship is from September 7th to December 23rd, so by the time I'm writing this I've started almost a month ago. As of now I'm working with Java but officially I am to help design the interface in React Typescript.

**October 3rd**
My first task was given to me last Wednesday, I had Thursday and Friday off so this is my second day working on my task. It basically consists of refactoring some codes into a new class. I've been reading a lot of documentation but tomorrow morning I have a few questions I will ask my team leader to help me understand better the overall project and to make sure I'm on the right path.

**October 4th**
I asked my team leader for some help this morning and continued working on my task. We had an hour long meeting in the afternoon to talk about Azure architecture and talk about things related to what we're doing. 

**October 5th**
Finished my task, tomorrow we will make sure the tests that run parallel to it work properly. We had the end of our 3 weeks sprint today, so there was a few meetings about that, and another explaining Autonodo to a team that will test run it. 

**October 6th**
Start working on an interface to be able to do tests relating to Denodo. It's in react typescript and I'll probably be working on it for the duration of my internship. Talked about the next sprint and had a few "récits" laid out for me.

**October 7th**
Continued working on my interface, did the navbar and the header, made sure everything was in order. Installed the right dependencies and what not.
